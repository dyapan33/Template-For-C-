## Building
To build this template repository for C++ you have to delete the .git folder by showing the hidden items, Change the License, README, and .gitignore and if you want your project to go on GitHub or other websites like GitHub, create a new repository on your account on whichever website like GitHub you prefer, and git clone it to the git-release folder and then once cloned to that folder get the items (including the .git folder) in the git-release folder out of the git-release folder and into the main folder, once that is done you can delete the git-release folder.
